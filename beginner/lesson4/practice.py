Practice exercises for lesson 4 of beginner Python.

# Level 1
# Ask the user if they want ice cream.
# If the user says no, keep asking!
# If the user says yes, print "yay!"

inp = input("Do you want ice cream? ")



# Level 2
# Goal: determine which numbers are even.
# Ask the user how many numbers we should check
# Use a loop to iterate through the numbers between 0 and the number of the user input
# Hint: use the modulus operator -> # % 2 == 1 means that the number is odd and # % 2 == 0 means the number is even

num = int(input("Input a positive number greater than 0. "))



# Level 3
# Print out all the prime numbers between 0 and a value that the user inputs.
# Use the % operator again to determine if a number evenly divides into another number.
# Use a nested loop to check each number.

num = int(input("Input a positive number greater than 0. "))
