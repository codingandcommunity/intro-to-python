Write a program that takes in an age from a user.
Then, have the user put in an "in-between age", something like 13.5 (if one is 
thirteen and a half) floating point. Which is a floating point integer
(or a float) and which is just a regular integer?

Next, try adding the two numbers and place that values in a separate variable.
Print that variable. Did it do what you expected it to do. What TYPE of number does it print?

#TODO your code here

How would you actually add the ages together? Change your program to show
the two ages added together.

Extension: If you finish that, try adding a float with ".0" to an integer.
